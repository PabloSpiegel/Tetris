Tetris
======
Hi everybody.
I used this summer C++ with allegro and to make Tetris.
At this moment, i will just upload the source that it's made to run in my computer. If you want to run it on yours, you will have to change it.  
I want to make available to every computer with using only the command make.
##Characteristics
At this moment there's only a simple tetris map in a black screen.
There is also a scoring system but I have to make it better.  
##Building instructions
At first, you have to install [allegro](https://www.allegro.cc/files/).  
In _makefile_, if you had not installed allegro in _/usr/local/lib_ you must change line x to your allegro installation path.
In the file _allegroprueba2.cpp_, you must adapt the path to your document folder.

With these steps you should make available my tetris implementation in your computer. Enjoy!
